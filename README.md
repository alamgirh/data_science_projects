### 1. Covid19 data exploration using SQL

In this project, I explored covid19 data (death and vaccination metrices). I created two tables in PosgresSQL and used SQL to do some data exploration. Data source link: [https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths)

### 2. Covid19 global data dashboard using Tableau

In this project, I extract data as excel files from PostgreSQL using SQL queries. Import these excel files in Tableau for creating a dashboard.
